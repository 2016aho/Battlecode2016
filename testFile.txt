For all your gitlab testing needs!
step 1) "git pull"
step 2) make your changes and ONLY MOVE ON WHEN THERE ARE NO BUGS IN YOUR CODE
step 3) "git add [name of file]" if you made a new file otherwise skip this
step
step 4) "git commit -m "[insert your descriptive message about what you did]""
step 5) "git push" 

steps for when there are conflicts and merges will come later :P
